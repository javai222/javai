🚀 OOP Full-Stack Lab Exercise (React + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL)
🎯 Objective
Build a full-stack web application that demonstrates:

Frontend development using React (Vite + TypeScript)
Backend development using Spring Boot (Java + JPA)
Database integration using PostgreSQL
Application of OOP principles across frontend and backend
🧠 Challenge Goal
By completing this exercise you should demonstrate:

Encapsulation (state management, entity design)
Abstraction (API layer, repositories)
Separation of Concerns (Frontend ↔ Backend ↔ Database)
Full CRUD functionality
Successful frontend-backend integration
📁 Required Folder Structure
Each student must create a folder using their SURNAME:

/<YourSurname>
 ├── frontend/        (React Vite Project)
 ├── backend/         (Spring Boot Project)
 └── evidence/        (Screenshots / Screen Recording)
🧩 Application Requirement
Create a web application that manages a list of:

Products OR
Tasks OR
Employees
🔄 Required Features (CRUD)
Your application must support:

✅ Get All Items
✅ Add Item
✅ Update Item
✅ Delete Item
🌐 Frontend Requirements (React + TypeScript)
Use React with Vite
Use TypeScript
Create components for:
List display
Form input
Use fetch or axios to call backend APIs
Maintain proper state management
🧠 OOP Concepts (Frontend)
Encapsulation → component state
Abstraction → API calls hidden in functions/services
Separation of concerns → UI vs logic
⚙️ Backend Requirements (Spring Boot)
Use:
Spring Web
Spring Data JPA
Implement:
Entity
Repository
Service
Controller
Provide full CRUD endpoints
🐘 Database Requirement (PostgreSQL)
Must connect to PostgreSQL
Must:
Create tables automatically (JPA)
Persist data beyond restart
🧠 OOP Concepts (Backend)
Encapsulation → private fields in entity
Abstraction → repository layer
Polymorphism → JpaRepository
Separation of concerns → layered architecture
🔗 Integration Requirement
Frontend must successfully:
Fetch data from backend
Send data (POST, PUT, DELETE)
Data must be reflected in the UI
🎥 Evidence Requirement (MANDATORY)
After completing integration:

Inside /evidence folder:

🎥 Screen Recording (REQUIRED)
Show:
Get all items
Add item
Update item
Delete item
Clearly demonstrate:
UI updates
Data persistence
🔥 Minimum Checklist
[ ] React frontend created

[ ] UI updates correctly
[ ] Screen recording added
🔥 Bonus Points
[ ] Use DTOs
[ ] Add validation
[ ] Add error handling
[ ] Use better UI styling
[ ] Add loading states
🔄 Git Workflow
Create your folder:
<YourSurname>
Commit your work regularly

Push to your branch

Create a PR to main

🔚 Final Tasks (ALWAYS INCLUDE)
8. Review and Retrospect
Think of at least 2 things you could have done better

9. Update your changelog files
a. Team changelog:
<Name> <StudentNo/ID> <MM/DD/YYYY> <LabTopic> Completed!
b. Personal .md:
<MM/DD/YYYY> : I learned _____ and next time I will _____
c. Peer feedback:
<MM/DD/YYYY> : Comment by: <COMMENTER's name>; You did well in _____ and you can improve by _____
d. Create a PR
Ask 2 teammates to approve and comment:
"I confirm that <Your Name> completed this lab."

💡 Final Insight
“Frontend and backend are separate systems, but good OOP design allows them to work together seamlessly.”
